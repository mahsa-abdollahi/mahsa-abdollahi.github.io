I am a machine learning researcher with a strong background in applied data science, signal processing, and model development for real-world noisy datasets. My work focuses on designing robust end-to-end machine learning pipelines, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation, using both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches.

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Telecommunications at **INRS (Montréal, Canada)**, where my research lies at the intersection of machine learning, acoustic signal processing, and real-world monitoring systems. My research emphasizes practical ML solutions for complex audio and time-series data, with a particular focus on robustness, interpretability, and performance under noisy conditions.

Previously, I have worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Research Assistant**, developing supervised and unsupervised models for audio, image, and time-series datasets. I have experience with handcrafted feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms, modulation features) as well as learned representations using deep neural networks such as CNNs and CRDNNs. I regularly work with models including SVMs, Random Forests, KNN, and deep learning architectures implemented in Python.

My work has resulted in peer-reviewed publications in venues such as *Scientific Data*, *IEEE*, and *Applied Sciences*. I enjoy collaborating with interdisciplinary teams and translating domain-specific problems into effective machine learning solutions.

I am particularly interested in applied machine learning, acoustic monitoring, and building reliable ML systems that operate on large-scale, real-world data.
